# axOS
This is a small one man project. I am trying to make a usable computer from an arduino. This includes a compiler, a text-editor and being able to access the filesystem.

axOS stands for axOS Operating System. 

## Features at the moment
- [x] Print text to a screen and take in commands.
- [ ] Be able to use a keyboard.
- [ ] Compiler.
- [ ] Text editor.
- [ ] Maybe internet access?

## What do you need to use this.
This project consists of electrical stuff ordered from Ebay. You can put this together fairly cheaply. 

You need an arduino compatible display (My version uses a 4 rows and 20 colums display, with a I2C controller) You also need a legit arduino, or a chinese knock-off. I personally use the knock-off as I can get 10 of those for the price for the price of an genuine arduino. Everything should work on a genuine one as well. Later you'll probably need a ps/2 adapter and an old keyboard.
